# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Kieran!

[My pronouns are he/him](https://pronoun.is/he).

**I'm a front-end developer** with a particular interest in:

* Accessibility
* Privacy
* User experience
* Web performance

**I write about front-end web development** with a focus on [The Lean Web](https://leanweb.dev/). I'm inspired by Nathan Barry's motto, "[teach everything you know](https://nathanbarry.com/89697-reasons-to-teach/)". I also take a lot of inspiration from my friend and mentor, [Chris Ferdinandi](https://github.com/cferdinandi).
